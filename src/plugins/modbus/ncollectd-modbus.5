.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBmodbus\fP connects to a Modbus "slave" via Modbus/TCP or Modbus/RTU and
reads register values. It supports reading single registers (unsigned 16 bit
values), large integer values (unsigned 32 bit and 64 bit values) and
floating point values (two registers interpreted as IEEE floats in big endian
notation).
.TP
\fBdata\fP \fIname\fP
Data blocks define a mapping between register numbers and the metrics used by
\fIncollectd\fP.

Within \fBdata\fP blocks, the following options are allowed:
.RS
.TP
\fBregister-base\fP \fInumber\fP
Configures the base register to read from the device. If the option
\fBregister-type\fP has been set to \fBuint32\fP or \fBfloat\fP, this and the next
register will be read (the register number is increased by one).
.TP
\fBregister-type\fP \fIint16|int32|int64|uint16|uint32|uint64|float|int32le|int32le|floatle\fP
Specifies what kind of data is returned by the device. This defaults to
\fBuint16\fP.  If the type is \fBint32\fP, \fBint32le\fP, \fBuint32\fP, \fBint32le\fP
\fBfloat\fP or \fBfloatle\fP, two 16 bit registers at \fBregister-base\fP
and \fBregister-rase+1\fP will be read and the data is combined into one
32 value. For \fBint32\fP, \fBuint32\fP and \fBfloat\fP the most significant
16 bits are in the register at \fBregister-base\fP and the least
significant 16 bits are in the register at \fBregister-base+1\fP.
For \fBint32le\fP, \fBuint32le\fP, or \fBfloat32le\fP, the high and low order
registers are swapped with the most significant 16 bits in
the \fBregister-base+1\fP and the least significant 16 bits in
\fBregister-base\fP. If the type is \fBint64\fP or \fBuint64\fP, four 16 bit
registers at \fBregister-base\fP, \fBregister-base+1\fP, \fBregister-base+2\fP and
\fBregister-base+3\fP will be read and the data combined into one
64 value.
.TP
\fBregister-cmd\fP \fIread-holding|read-input\fP
Specifies register type to be collected from device. Works only with libmodbus
2.9.2 or higher. Defaults to \fBread-holding\fP.
.TP
\fBmetric\fP \fImetric\fP
Set the metric name.
.TP
\fBhelp\fP \fIhelp\fP
Set the \fBhelp\fP text for the metric.
.TP
\fBlabel\fP \fIkey\fP \fIvalue\fP
Append the label \fIkey\fP=\fIvalue\fP to the submitting metrics. Can appear
multiple times in the \fBdata\fP block.
.TP
\fBtype\fP \fIgauge|counter|unknow\fP
The \fBtype\fP for the metric. Must be \fIgauge\fP, \fIcounter\fP or \fIunknow\fP.
If not set is \fIunknow\fP.
There must be exactly one \fBtype\fP option inside each \fBdata\fP block.
.TP
\fBscale\fP \fIvalue\fP
The values taken from device are multiplied by \fIvalue\fP. The field is optional
and the default is \fB1.0\fP.
.TP
\fBshift\fP \fIvalue\fP
\fIValue\fP is added to values from device after they have been multiplied by
\fBscale\fP value. The field is optional and the default value is \fB0.0\fP.
.RE
.TP
\fBhost\fP \fIname\fB
Host blocks are used to specify to which hosts to connect and what data to read
from their "slaves". The string argument \fIname\fP is used as hostname when
dispatching the values to \fIncollectd\fP.

Within \fBhost\fP blocks, the following options are allowed:
.RS
.TP
\fBaddress\fP \fIhostname\fP
For Modbus/TCP, specifies the node name (the actual network address) used to
connect to the host. This may be an IP address or a hostname. Please note that
the used \fIlibmodbus\fP library only supports IPv4 at the moment.
.TP
\fBport\fP \fIservice\fP
For Modbus/TCP, specifies the port used to connect to the host. The port can
either be given as a number or as a service name. Please note that the
\fIservice\fP argument must be a string, even if ports are given in their numerical
form. Defaults to "502".
.TP
\fBdevice\fP \fIdevicenode\fP
For Modbus/RTU, specifies the path to the serial device being used.
.TP
\fBbaudrate\fP \fIbaudrate\fP
For Modbus/RTU, specifies the baud rate of the serial device.
Note, connections currently support only 8/N/1.
.TP
\fBuart-type\fP \fIRS485|RS422|RS232\fP
For Modbus/RTU, specifies the type of the serial device.
RS232, RS422 and RS485 are supported. Defaults to RS232.
Available only on Linux systems with libmodbus>=2.9.4.
.TP
\fBinterval\fP \fIinterval\fP
Sets the interval (in seconds) in which the values will be collected from this
host. By default the global \fBinterval\fP setting will be used.
.TP
\fBmetric-prefix\fP \fIprefix\fP
Prepends \fIprefix\fP to the metric name in the \fBdata\fP.
.TP
\fBlabel\fP \fIkey\fP \fIvalue\fP
Append the label \fIkey\fP=\fIvalue\fP to the submitting metrics. Can appear
multiple times in the \fBhost\fP block.
.TP
\fBslave\fP \fIsalve\fP
Over each connection, multiple Modbus devices may be reached. The slave ID
is used to specify which device should be addressed. For each device you want
to query, one \fBslave\fP block must be given.

Within \fBslave\fP blocks, the following options are allowed:
.RS
.TP
\fBmetric-prefix\fP \fIprefix\fP
Prepends \fIprefix\fP to the metric name in the \fBdata\fP.
.TP
\fBlabel\fP \fIkey\fP \fIvalue\fP
Append the label \fIkey\fP=\fIvalue\fP to the submitting metrics. Can appear
multiple times in the \fBslave\fP block.
.TP
\fBcollect\fP \fIdata-name\fP
Specifies which data to retrieve from the device. \fIdata-name\fP must be the same
string as the \fIname\fP argument passed to a \fBdata\fP block. You can specify this
option multiple times to collect more than one value from a slave. At least one
\fBcollect\fP option is mandatory.
